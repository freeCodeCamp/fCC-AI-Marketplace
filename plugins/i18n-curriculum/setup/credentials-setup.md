# Credentials Setup Guide

This guide must be completed by every team member before using Carmen or Marcos.
It takes about 10 minutes the first time.

## Part 1 — Google Sheets access (Admin only, done once for the whole team)

One person on the team creates the service account and shares the credentials with everyone else. This is a one-time setup.

### Step 1 — Create a Google Cloud project (or use an existing one)

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Click the project dropdown at the top → **New Project**
3. Name it `i18n-curriculum` → **Create**

### Step 2 — Enable the Google Sheets API

1. In the project, go to **APIs & Services → Library**
2. Search for **Google Sheets API** → click it → **Enable**

### Step 3 — Create a service account

1. Go to **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts**
2. Click **Create Service Account**
3. Name: `curriculum-pipeline` → click **Create and Continue** → **Done**
4. Click on the new service account → **Keys** tab
5. **Add Key → Create new key → JSON** → download the file
6. Rename the downloaded file to `curriculum-credentials.json`

### Step 4 — Share the Google Sheet with the service account

1. Open the JSON file and copy the `client_email` value
   (it looks like `curriculum-pipeline@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
2. Open the planning Google Sheet → click **Share**
3. Paste the service account email → set to **Editor** → **Send**

### Step 5 — Share credentials securely with the team

Send the `curriculum-credentials.json` file to each team member via a secure
channel (Slack DM, encrypted email, 1Password shared vault, etc.).

**Never commit this file to Git.**

## Part 2 — Each team member setup

Every team member does this after receiving the credentials JSON from the admin.

### Step 1 — Store the credentials as an environment variable

Open the JSON file in a text editor and copy its entire contents.

**Mac / Linux (zsh):**

```bash
# Open your shell config
nano ~/.zshrc

# Add this line at the bottom (replace the {...} with the actual JSON content):
export GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"...","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"...","client_email":"...","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"...","token_uri":"...","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"...","client_x509_cert_url":"..."}'

# Save and reload
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Mac / Linux (bash):**

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# Same line as above
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Add to your PowerShell profile (run to find the path):
echo $PROFILE

# Open it and add:
$env:GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON = '{"type":"service_account",...}'
```

### Step 2 — Verify it works

```bash
python3 -c "
import gspread, json, os
creds = json.loads(os.environ['GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON'])
gc = gspread.service_account_from_dict(creds)
print('✅ Google Sheets connection works')
"
```

If you see `✅ Google Sheets connection works`, you're done.

If you get an error:

- `KeyError: 'GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON'` → the env variable wasn't saved. Restart your terminal and try again.
- `ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded` → check that the JSON is complete and not truncated.
- `gspread not found` → run `pip install gspread --break-system-packages` first.

## Part 3 — Git repo setup (each team member)

Marcos writes task files directly into a cloned Git repository. Each team member needs their own clone.

### Step 1 — Clone the curriculum repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_CURRICULUM_REPO.git
cd YOUR_CURRICULUM_REPO
```

### Step 2 — Set up the GitHub CLI (for PR creation)

Marcos instructs you to open PRs using the GitHub CLI (`gh`). Make sure it is
installed and authenticated before your first session:

```bash
# Install (if not already installed)
# Mac:   brew install gh
# Linux: https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

Marcos will provide the exact `gh pr create` command at the end of each session.
You run it yourself — no token or plugin configuration is required.

## Part 4 — Language framework (each team member, before first session)

Carmen needs access to the official language framework for the target language
being taught. This is used to identify and rank teachable concepts at each CEFR level.

**You do not need to configure this in advance.** Carmen will ask for it at the
start of every session. Have one of the following ready:

- **A URL** to the official online framework document
  (e.g., PCIC for Spanish, QCER for Portuguese, CECRL for French,
  Goethe-Institut Curriculum for German)
- **A local file** you have prepared with the framework inventory for your target language
- **A spreadsheet tab name** if your planning spreadsheet already has the framework
  concept inventory loaded (common for teams that have been using the plugin for a while)

Carmen will ask:
> _"What official language framework should I use? You can give me a URL, a local
> file, or point me to a tab in the spreadsheet."_

| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Carmen | `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env var | Set in shell profile               |
| Carmen | Language framework source             | Provided by user each session      |
| Marcos | `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` env var | Set in shell profile               |
| Marcos | Cloned repo path                      | Told by user each session          |
| Marcos | Feature branch                        | User creates; Marcos checks        |
| Both   | Sheet URL                             | Provided by user each session      |
